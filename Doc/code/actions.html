Suppose you're writing a passage like this:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The door opens into a narrow sloping corridor which leads into another chamber. The walls are covered with hieroglyphics, and there are three clay pots standing on top of a stone table. Will you:
</p>

<p>
Lift the lid of the white pot?<span style="float: right">Turn to <b>14</b></span><br clear="both" />
Lift the lid of the black pot?<span style="float: right">Turn to <b>156</b></span><br clear="both" />
Lift the lid of the red pot?<span style="float: right">Turn to <b>183</b></span><br clear="both" />
Walk through the chamber to the archway in the far wall?<span style="float: right">Turn to <b>20</b></span><br clear="both" />
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Lifting the lid of one pot shouldn't preclude the protagonist from lifting the lid of another afterwards &mdash; assuming, of course, that the pots don't kill the protagonist (which, unfortunately, they often do in these kinds of gamebooks). The <code>&lt;&lt;actions&gt;&gt;</code> macro shows the reader a list of choices, <b>excluding any he has already seen.</b> You can combine this with the <code>&lt;&lt;display&gt;&gt;</code> macro to implement the passage above:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><code>
<b>Pot Chamber</b><br />
The door opens into a narrow sloping corridor which leads into another chamber. The walls are covered with hieroglyphics, and there are three clay pots standing on top of a stone table.<br />
&lt;&lt;display "Pot actions"&gt;&gt;
</code></p>

<p><code>
<b>Pot actions</b><br />
&lt;&lt;actions "Lift the lid of the white pot" "Lift the lid of the black pot" "Lift the lid of the red pot" "Walk to the archway"&gt;&gt;
</code></p>

<p><code>
<b>Lift the lid of the white pot</b><br />
There are chocolates inside! And they're delicious.<br />
&lt;&lt;display "Pot actions"&gt;&gt;
</code></p>

<p><code>
<b>Lift the lid of the black pot</b><br />
There's licorice inside. You've never been that much of a fan, but maybe someone you encounter on your quest will like them.<br />
&lt;&lt;display "Pot actions"&gt;&gt;
</code></p>

<p><code>
<b>Lift the lid of the red pot</b><br />
It's empty! Looks like someone got here before you did.<br />
&lt;&lt;display "Pot actions"&gt;&gt;
</code></p>

<p><code>
<b>Walk to the archway</b><br />
You continue on your brave quest...
</code></p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The reader can open one, none, or several pots in the room before proceeding onward. Make sure you have at least one choice that does not lead back to the <code>&lt;&lt;actions&gt;&gt;</code> macro. Otherwise, readers won't be able to continue.
