<p>
Just as you can tag a passage <code>stylesheet</code> to have its contents treated as CSS style rules,
you can use the <b>script</b> tag to include custom JavaScript in your story. All passages with this tag
are executed when the page loads, which you can use as an opportunity to do two things:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Perform some initialization.</b> This passage asks readers what their names are when they first open the story:

<blockquote><code>
prompt("Hi! What's your name?");
</code></blockquote>

This example is not particularly useful, but if you are integrating extra JavaScript code into your story, this can be a useful way to do some initialization.

</li>

<li>
<b>Modify how your story will work.</b> To do this properly requires careful inspection of the <a href="http://gimcrackd.com/etc/api/">Twee API</a>,
which is outside the scope of this document. As an example, however, this passage forces only one passage to be displayed at a time in the Jonah story template:

<blockquote><code><pre>
History.prototype.originalDisplay = History.prototype.display;

History.prototype.display = function (title, link, render)
{
	if ((render != 'quietly') && (render != 'offscreen'))
		removeChildren($('passages'));
		
	this.originalDisplay.apply(this, arguments);
};
</pre></code></blockquote>

</li>

</ul>

<p class="caution">
The execution order of passages tagged <b>script</b> is not guaranteed.
</p>
