Let's add some interactivity to the story by allowing the reader to look at the newspaper in their hand. Add this passage so your source code looks like this:
</p>

<blockquote><code>
:: Start<br />
It's a dark and stormy night aboard the Orient Express. You can't sleep; something about the motion of the train disturbed you subtly. So instead you have elected to spend the night in the dining car, sipping coffee and perusing the newspaper.
<br />
<br />
You hear the door to the car open behind you, but you don't look up at first.
<br />
<br />
<br />
:: the newspaper<br />
If you believe what you read, the world is quiet. The London Times' front page is awash in some lurid tale of a fellow named John Lee whose execution failed thrice, and thus proven innocent -- or at least innocent enough to serve a life sentence. 
</code></blockquote>

<b>It's a good idea to put at least two empty lines between passages</b> so that you can pick them out easily. But you can put in as many empty lines as you like.
</p>

<p>
If you do this, you'll notice the resulting story looks the same as before. Even though we now have two passages, we have to link them together. This may seem obvious, but it's important to keep in mind while you write. <b>If a passage has no links to it, readers will never see it.</b>
