Once you've finished a story, you may want to look over a printed copy of your text to make sure you
haven't made any typos or other mistakes. While you can print out your source code directly, it isn't
particularly easy to skim across, and if you share it with people who don't know Twee, the formatting
codes can be confusing.

Instead, it can be easier to generate an RTF-formatted file of your story. RTF format is a sort of shared
format that many word processors use, including Microsoft Word. As a side benefit, you can also make edits
in a RTF document electronically through the Track Changes feature, or something similar.

<p>
If you use Tweebox, then choose the <b>Proof Story</b> option from the <b>Project</b> menu to create an
RTF version of your story. It will be given the same name as the normal story file, but with an <b>.rtf</b>
file suffix instead of an <b>.htm</b> or <b>.html</b>.
</p>

<p>
If you use command-line tools like <i>twee</i>, then there's a corresponding one named <i>toward</i>.
(It's kind of a pun on the phrase "to Word (format"). Pass it any number of source files, and it will output
an RTF document. You'll probably want to direct the output to a file, like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
$ toward *.tw > proof.rtf
</code>
