<p>
Let's get started with a simple passage. Open up your text editor and type this into a new document:
</p>
 
<blockquote><code>

:: Start<br />
It's a dark and stormy night aboard the Orient Express. You can't sleep; something about the motion
of the train disturbed you subtly. So instead you have elected to spend the night in the dining car,
sipping coffee and perusing the newspaper.

</code></blockquote>

<p class="info">
The examples in this document use the traditional second-person present tense point of view found in
a Choose Your Own Adventure story. But this isn't the only perspective you could use in a story.
</p>

<p>
<b>To create a passage in source code, put two colons before its title, then skip a line, then
enter its text.</b> To add paragraph breaks inside a passage, skip two lines like this:
</p>

<blockquote><code>

:: Start<br />
It's a dark and stormy night aboard the Orient Express. You can't sleep; something about the motion of the train
disturbed you subtly. So instead you have elected to spend the night in the dining car, sipping coffee and
perusing the newspaper.
<br />
<br />
You hear the door to the car open behind you, but you don't look up at first.
</code></blockquote>

<p>
In this case, the amount of line spacing you use is important. If you put in too little, your source code
won't be understood properly; if you use too much, your story will have extra whitespace.
</p>

<p>
Save this to a file named <code>orient.tw</code>. It's best to end source file names with the <code>.tw</code>
extension, to keep them separate from other kinds of files. 
</p>

<p class="info">
Using a <code>.tw</code> file extension can confuse your computer at first, since it doesn't know what a
<code>.tw</code> file is supposed to be. How you teach your computer this depends on whether you're using
Windows or a Mac, but if you have trouble getting it to work, try using a <code>.txt</code> extension instead.
</p>

<p>
Now try turning this source code into a story in the Jonah format. If you're not sure how to accomplish this,
check <a href="../beforeyoubegin/tweebox.html">Setting Up Tweebox</a> or
<a href="../beforeyoubegin/twee.html">Setting Up Twee</a>. When you open the resulting file, you should see
something like this:
</p>

</p>

<p>
It's not very exciting to look at yet, but it's a start. Let's go over some things you can do with your story even its current state. First of all, there's a <b>Restart Story</b> link in the upper-right corner of the page. Clicking this restores your story to its initial state. Right now, it doesn't change anything since there's only one passage to the story.
</p>

<p>
At the the top of the page is your story's title. We'll talk about how to change this in <a href="../simple/finishing.html">Finishing Up</a>; if you don't set a story title, your story is simply called <i>Untitled Story</i>.
</p>

<p>
The first passage of your story appears underneath the title. By convention, the first passage of your story is called <b>Start</b>; there's a way to change this, too, that we'll talk about later. There are two links for each passage in your story: <b>Bookmark</b>, which lets readers save a certain point in your story to come back to, and <b>Rewind to Here</b>, which lets readers return to an earlier point in your story.
