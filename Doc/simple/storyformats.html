<p>
There are two main story templates available to you: Jonah and Sugarcane. The examples in this documentation
use Jonah formatting for simplicity's sake. In a Jonah-formatted story, each new passage appears below the one
that contained the link to it, so that a reader can see the entire story by scrolling up and down. A reader
can "rewind" the progress of the story by clicking the <i>Rewind to Here</i> link beside each passage's heading.
This format is sometimes referred to as <b>stretchtext</b>, for the way the story seems to grow in place in
response to the reader's clicks.
</p>

<p>
The Sugarcane template only shows the most recent passage to a reader. It's like reading a printed
gamebook, where only the most current passage is visible to the reader. Readers can jump back to a previous point
in the story by using their browser's back button, or by choosing from the <b>Rewind</b> link that appears on the
left side of every page. This link works differently from the back button: it lets readers jump to major decision
points in your story, which you choose.
</p>

<p>
To make a passage appear in Sugarcane's Rewind menu, you'll need to use the bookmark <b>tag</b>. Tags are also
used to <a href="customizing/appearance.html">customize your story's appearance and behavior</a>; they act like
extra labels for a passage so that it is treated specially. Here's how you add the bookmark tag to a passage in
your source code:
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
:: Between A Rock And A Hard Place [bookmark]<br />
Well, what will it be? The [[rock]] or the [[hard place]]?
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
When a reader encounters a passage like this, it is automatically added to the Rewind menu.
</p>

<p>
The final trick to using the Sugarcane template is guiding readers out of dead ends. Sometimes you create
a passage where the only action a reader can take is to go back to the previous one &mdash; for example, if
it is just to add a little extra detail. While readers can use their back button to get back onto the main
thread of the story, it's helpful to let them know that there isn't any way to go forward from a passage by
placing a "Back" link into the text of a passage.
</p>

<p>
There's a special shortcut that makes these easy to create. Simply type <code>&lt;&lt;back&gt;&gt;</code>
at the end of your passage's source code, and Sugarcane will create a link labeled "Back" for you there. If you
would like the "Back" link to point to a specific passage &mdash; for example, to allow the reader to skip back
up to a top level &mdash; put its name in quotation marks like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<code>
:: You're done!<br />
You've completed chapter 17, on the properties of boron. Congratulations on muddling on through.<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;back "Table of Contents"&gt;&gt;</code> 
</blockquote>

This is an example of <a href="code/why.html">a macro</a>. Macros are covered later in this document, but
you don't need to worry about it 
</p>

<p>
Finally, the two templates use different color schemes, but you can easily
<a href="customizing/appearance.html">modify them</a>. To switch between them, use the <b>Story Format</b> menu in
Tweebox, or the <code>-t</code> switch in <i>twee</i>.
