<p>
To edit a passage, you can either double-click it on the story map or select it, then choose <b>Edit
Passage</b> from the <b>Story</b> menu. (You can open several passages for editing this way.)
</p>

<p>
The editor window has three main fields: the title of the passage, any tags that it has, and the body text.
As you make changes here, the story map will update itself automatically. Close the window when you're done working.
</p>

<p>
The editor window's <b>Passage</b> menu contains a list of passages that the one you're editing link to
(the <b>Outgoing Links</b> submenu), other passages that link to this one (<b>Incoming Links</b>), and links from this passage
that don't have matching passages (<b>Broken Links</b>). Selecting a passage title from these menus will open it
if it already exists, or create a new passage with the appropriate title if it doesn't.
</p>

<p>
To concentrate just on a passage's text, choose <b>View Fullscreen</b> from the <b>Passage</b> menu. In the
fullscreen view, press the Escape key to close the passage and return to the story map, or press F12 to switch
back to the windowed view.
