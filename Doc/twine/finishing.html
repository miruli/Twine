To create an output file for your story that is readable in a Web browser, choose
<b>Build Story</b> from your story map window's <b>Story</b> menu. This prompts you
to choose where to save your finished story; make sure to give the file a <code>.html</code>
file extension. After you've saved your output file, Twine will open it for you in
your Web browser.

<p>
Once you've build your story once, you can quickly rebuild it to reflect changes you've made
by choosing <b>Rebuild Story</b> from the <b>Story</b> menu. For ease of access, this menu item
also appears in the <b>Passage</b> menu of passage editing windows. Keep in mind that you'll need
to reload your output story in your Web browser once you rebuild it. If you lose track of the file,
the <b>View Last Build</b> menu item will open it your browser once more.

<p>
To check how long your story has become, choose <b>Story Statistics</b> from the <b>Story</b>
menu. This counts how many words, passages, and links your story contains. It also displays
how many broken links there are, so you can do a final check to make sure your story is complete.
</p>

<p>
You can generate an RTF version of your story suitable for proofreading by choosing <b>Export
Proofing Copy</b> from the <b>File</b> menu. This compiles all of your passages into a single document
that can be opened up in a word processor like Word or OpenOffice.
