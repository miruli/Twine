<p>
To create a link in a passage, select the text you'd like to use for the link and then choose
<b>Create Link</b>, the first item on the <b>Passage</b> menu. This adds square brackets around the
text you've selected, creates a new passage for the link to go to, and opens it for you for editing.
</p>

<p>
If you've already created a passage to match that text, the menu item will read <b>Edit
Passage</b> instead, and will open the linked passage in a separate window.
</p>

<p>
If one of your passages contains a broken link &mdash; that is, it has a link pointing outward
that does not have a matching passage &mdash; then an exclamation point emblem will appear on the
passage on your story map, to warn you that there is a problem.
</p>

<p>
To remove a link, just delete the double brackets around the text.
