<h2>Tweebox in 30 Seconds</h2>

<p>
This page goes over the basics of using Tweebox to compile a TiddlyWiki. It doesn't try to explain anything except what clicking things does. <i>Building Simple Stories</i>, on the left, is a much better general introduction.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Projects toolbar</b> appears directly underneath tweeBox's title. A project is a collection of source files and settings. Switch projects with the pull-down menu on the left side of the toolbar. Add and remove projects with the buttons on the right side.
</p>

<p>
Below the Projects toolbar is information about the current project.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Source Files</b> section shows the Twee source files currently part of the project. Add a file by clicking the <b>Browse</b> button at the bottom of the list. Remove it by clicking the minus-sign button beside the file.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Save Story As</b> section lets you choose where the compiled TiddlyWiki file will be saved. You may only save to the same folders that your source code is in. If you have source files spread across several folders, you can choose from them with a drop-down menu. Type in the file name you'd like to use. This name must end in <b>.htm</b> or <b>.html</b>.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Author name</b> field contains the author's name &mdash; not all kinds of TiddlyWikis show this information, however. The <b>Story Format</b> menu lets you choose what kind of TiddlyWiki to create. Choices include:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Jonah</b>: a standalone format intended for Choose Your Own Adventure-style stories.</li>
<li><b>TiddlyWiki 2</b> and <b>TiddlyWiki</b>: standard formats created by Jeremy Ruston.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Click the <b>Build</b> button to compile your Twee files. Once it finishes, Tweebox tries to open your created file in a new window. Often, pop-up blockers will prevent this from happening; a small notification box will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen with a button to view your new TiddlyWiki.
