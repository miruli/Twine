<h2>The &lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt; Macro</h2>

<p>
Sometimes you'll want to do many things in a single tiddler. It's a good idea to put each command on a separate line, to make it easier to read. Unfortunately, this inserts blank lines in your tiddler when it's displayed &mdash; not very aesthetically pleasing.
</p>

<p>
This is where the <code>&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;</code> macro comes in. Just like <code>&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;</code>, it has a end macro &mdash; <code>&lt;&lt;endsilently&gt;&gt;</code>. Everything between the two is evaluated silently, without the user seeing anything.
</p>

<p>
There's one important trick to this macro: it doesn't show anything at all, <b>including error messages</b>. So if something isn't going right with your tiddler, try taking out the <code>&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;</code> macro and see if an error message pops up.
</p>

<p>
This macro is ideal for setting up the state of the story at its outset. Here's how you might do things:
</p>

<p class="code">
:: Startup<br />
&lt;&lt;silently&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;tiddler '(setup)'&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endsilently&gt;&gt;It's the first day of the school year...<br />
<br />
<br />
:: (setup)<br />
&lt;&lt;set classesCut = 0&gt;&gt;<br />
&lt;&lt;set lunchMoney = 2.25&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>
So, you've made it to the end! Those are all the macros built into Jonah. You should be able to do some fairly sophsticated things now. Give it a try!
