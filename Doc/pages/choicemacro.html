<h2>The &lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt; Macro</h2>

<p>
The <code>&lt;&lt;choice&gt;&gt;</code> macro locks away paths in your story. A choice looks exactly like a regular link, but as soon as it's clicked, it disables all the other choices in the same tiddler. Here's how it might work:
</p>

<p class="code">
:: Start<br />
It's a dark and stormy night aboard the [[Orient Express|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient_Express]]. You can't sleep; something about the motion of the train disturbed you subtly. So instead you have elected to spend the night in the dining car, sipping coffee and perusing [[the newspaper]].<br />
<br />
"Hello?" a female voice asks from behind you, perhaps from the entrance of the car.<br />
* &lt;&lt;choice "Turn around"&gt;&gt;<br />
* &lt;&lt;choice "Keep reading"&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>
Since choices require more thought than your average link, it's a good idea to format them a little differently than regular links. One popular way to do it is to use bullets, but it's up to you.
</p>

<p class="developer">
Choices are classed <b>choice</b> in CSS, so you can change their formatting with the selector <code>span.choice</code>.

<p class="prev">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('maskmacro')"><img src="img/prev.png" width="32" height="32" alt="" /></a> <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('maskmacro')">Previous</a>
</p>

<p class="next">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('actionsmacro')">Next</a> <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('actionsmacro')"><img src="img/next.png" width="32" height="32" alt="" /></a>
