<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>
Before you start, you'll need some basic tools. Luckily for you, none of them cost any money.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<b>A Web browser</b><br />
If you're reading this, you have one! Tweebox, the application that builds stories for you, requires either a Gecko-based browser (that means Netscape 6 or 7, Mozilla, Firefox, or Camino) or Internet Explorer 6 or higher.
</p>

<p class="info">
The files Tweebox makes can be read by many more browsers than this &mdash; notably Opera and Safari. So your readers won't need to worry about this requirement. 
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>A text editor</b><br />
This is different from a <i>word processor</i>. Word processors let you work with page layout, fonts, and other kinds of formatting. Text editors don't. You just type in text and that's it.
</p>

<p>
If you like using a word processor like Microsoft Word to write, you can continue doing so. You just need to save your files in text-only format. In Microsoft Word, you can set this in the <b>Save As...</b> dialog box. You'll know you've got it right when your document's icon suddenly looks less pretty, and its name ends in <b>.txt</b>.
</p>

<p>
If you don't already have a text editor, there's always Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on the Mac). These are built into the operating system, but there also a whole host of text editors out there on the Internet that are free. It might be worth it to spend some time looking for one you like.

<b>Tweebox</b><br />
This tool is what you'll use to build your stories. This guidebook is bundled with it, but you can always get the most current version at <a href="http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/" target="_blank">http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/</a>.

Got everything? Great. We're ready to begin.
