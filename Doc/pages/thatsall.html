<h2>That's All You Need To Know</h2>

<p>
Believe it or not, that's all you need to know to write a story that's as sophisticated as the average Choose Your Own Adventure. You give readers alternatives by linking to them at the end of a passage, and then you create passages explaining what happens next. If you'd like, you can build onto the Orient Express story we just started off with &mdash; if you remember from the <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('formatting')">Formatting</a> page, we added two choices for the reader to work with. Decide who that voice could be, then tell the reader what the results of his or her actions are.
</p>

<p>
Once your stories start getting bigger, it can be a good idea to split off sections into separate files. That way, you can locate a passage you want to change fairly easily. You can add as many source files as you want in Tweebox.
</p>

<p>
The next document, <i>Tricks with Twee</i>, shows you how to use more advanced techniques with your stories. For example, you'll notice that when you click a choice in this story, you can click the other one if you don't like the results of the first. Sure, you could cheat the same way with CYOA books, but we can do better than that.

<p>
There's a lot more possible, too.
