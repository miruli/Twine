<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document explains the basics of creating hypertext stories with a tool called Twee. Hypertext is a funny word &mdash; it means lots of things to different people. But here it means a story that isn't meant to be read from start to finish in a straight line.
</p>

<p>
Books work this way, right? You read a page and then move to the next. When you're out of pages, the story's done. Hypertext changes this &mdash; maybe after page 34, the reader turns to page 100 or page 67.
</p>

<p>
The most familiar kind of hypertext story you may have encountered before is a Choose Your Own Adventure-style story, where the reader chooses what the main character should do next. This is just one kind of structure your stories can follow, though.
</p>

<p>
So before we go any further, let's answer the obvious question. What exactly is Twee? It's a super-simple language that lets you write your story in your favorite word processor or text editor (more on the difference between the two later). You use an application named Tweebox to convert your Twee files into a Web page that presents your story interactively to readers. You can email this file to your friends or put it up on your Web site &mdash; it's a standalone file that works in any modern Web browser.
