<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
You've already read <i>Building Simple Stories</i> over there on the left, right? Well, that document explains how to write stories with Twee &mdash; emphasis on the writing. There's a tiny bit of glue with ::s, MainMenu, and so on, but mostly it's about how to bind your writing to the TiddlyWiki engine.

<p>
That's good enough to get you the equivalent of a printed Choose Your Own Adventure... which isn't too shabby. But we're using computers here! We can do some stuff that's above and beyond what the printed page allows.
</p>

<p>
What this ultimately involves is a pretty scary word: <i>programming</i>. If you want to, you can get really hardcore about things and do some amazing stuff. But you don't have to. The truth is, most of the programming you'll need to do to pull off your typical story with style and grace is extremely simple. We're talking a single line of code in a tiddler kind of simple.

We'll start quick and easy, and go from there.
