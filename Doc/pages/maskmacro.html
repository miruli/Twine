<h2>The &lt;&lt;mask&gt;&gt; Macro</h2>

<p>
The <code>&lt;&lt;mask&gt;&gt;</code> macro is very simple. All it does is disguise a link to a tiddler under a different name. The format of a <code>&lt;&lt;mask&gt;&gt;</code> invocation is:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;&lt;mask "existing tiddler" "displayed link"&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>
It's useful, for example, if you need to link to a tiddler in two places, where you would capitalize them differently. Remember that normally, links are case-sensitive.
</p>

:: Start<br />
It's a dark and stormy night aboard the Orient Express. You can't sleep; something about the motion of the train disturbed you subtly. So instead you have elected to spend the night in the dining car, sipping coffee and perusing the [[newspaper]].<br />
<br />
<br />
:: A reminder<br />
"&lt;&lt;mask "the newspaper" "The newspaper"&gt;&gt;, sir," the conductor says firmly. "You've dropped it."
<br />
<br />
:: the newspaper<br />
If you believe what you read, the world is quiet. The London Times' front page is awash in some lurid tale of a fellow named John Lee whose execution failed thrice, and thus proven innocent -- or at least innocent enough to serve a life sentence.
</p>

<p>
Notice how you can stick a macro right inside a regular sentence. That's going to come in handy later.
