<h2>Other Kinds of Links</h2>

<p>
You can link to other things besides passages. For example, if you wanted to split your story into several parts, or just link to a reference, you can specify a Web address instead:
</p>

<p class="code">
:: Start<br />
It's a dark and stormy night aboard the [[Orient Express|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orient_Express]]. You can't sleep; something about the motion of the train disturbed you subtly. So instead you have elected to spend the night in the dining car, sipping coffee and perusing the newspaper.
</p>

<p>
To do this, you type a vertical bar... that's a |, which is shift-backslash on American keyboards... between your text and the address you want to point to. External addresses appear with a solid underline in your story, to distinguish them from normal links.
</p>

<p>
You can also make a link to an e-mail address by putting ''mailto:'' in front of it, like this:
</p>

<p class="code">
:: Example<br />
Tell it to [[the chief|mailto:president@whitehouse.gov]].
</p>

<p class="prev">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('secondpassage')"><img src="img/prev.png" width="32" height="32" alt="" /></a> <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('secondpassage')">Previous</a>
</p>

<p class="next">
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('formatting')">Next</a> <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="showPage('formatting')"><img src="img/next.png" width="32" height="32" alt="" /></a>
</p>
