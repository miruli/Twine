<h2>Skipping Around</h2>

<p>
As your stories grow longer, you'll probably get tired of clicking around to get to the part you've just been working on. Jonah lets you skip directly to a tiddler you're working on to see what it looks like in action. Just hold down the Control and Alt keys (if you're using a Mac, hold down the Option key instead of Alt) and hit the T key. (T is short for Tiddler.)
</p>

<p>
A dialog box pops up asking you to type in a name of a tiddler. You have to get this exactly right, unfortunately, or you'll just get a message stating that the tiddler doesn't exist.

Also unfortunate is that this shortcut doesn't work in the Opera browser. Sorry! For some reason, Opera doesn't let Web pages know if you're holding down the Option or Alt key.
