Sometimes, it can be useful to add information about a passage that isn't visible to readers. <b>Tags</b>
are a way to do this &mdash; they function as labels stuck on the side of a passage, visible to you
while you are writing your story, but they cannot be seen in the published version of your story.

There are some tags that have special meaning to Twee, and change how your story behaves or appears
to your readers. These special tags are described in later sections of
this document. You are also free to assign tags to your passages if they help you keep organized. A
tag can be any series of letters, numbers, or punctuation without spaces. You can assign as many tags
as you like to a passage, as well.
