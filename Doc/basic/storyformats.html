<p>
When you publish your story to an HTML file, you can choose between <b>story formats</b>. These
story formats control both the basic appearance and behavior of your story, though you can customize
both of these via individual changes you make to your story.
</p>

<p>
There are two main story formats to choose from:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Jonah</b><br />
This displays your story with black text on a white background, and as a reader clicks links
in your story, the text expands. A reader can review earlier passages of your story by scrolling
upwards. This approach is called <i>stretchtext</i>.
</li>

<li>
<b>Sugarcane</b><br />
This displays your story with white text on a black background. Readers can only see one passage
at a time, though they can use their browsers' back buttons to return to a previous passage, or
use a special Rewind menu to jump back to particularly significant passages.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
You can switch story formats at any time.

<p class="info">
Both Twine and <i>twee</i> allow you to publish to <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>
format. This is included for backwards compatibility &mdash; both Jonah and Sugarcane are based on the
TiddlyWiki codebase &mdash; but don't make for particularly compelling story experiences.
