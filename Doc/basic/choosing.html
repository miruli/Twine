There are two applications for creating stories with Twee. Both have almost identical
capabilities; they differ only in the interface you use to create a story.
</p>

<p>
<b>Twine</b> provides a visual interface, where you can see a map of your story and
easily visualize connections between passages. It includes an integrated text editor
for editing passages. Most people will want to use Twine.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>twee</i></b> is meant to be run from the command line, after you write specially-formatted
text files with the text editor of your choice. If you already are comfortable with a specific
text editor or development environment, <i>twee</i> is a better choice for you. Creating stories
with <i>twee</i> can also be automated or included in other scripts much more easily than Twine can.
