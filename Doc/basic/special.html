There are certain passage names that have special meaning, and let you make your stories
look more polished. The most important is <b>Start</b>. It is the first passage displayed
when your story is first loaded by a reader.

<p>
The first is <b>StoryTitle</b>, which sets your story's title.
The other two are <b>StorySubtitle</b>, which lets you enter a brief subhead under the story,
and <b>StoryAuthor</b>, which sets a byline.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the <code>StoryMenu</code> passage lets you add items to the the menu that hovers
in the upper-right corner of the page in the Jonah story format, or on the left side of the page
in the Sugarcane story format. You can link directly to passages in your story from this menu.
</p>

<blockquote><code>
<b>About the Author</b><br />
P.F. Wossname is a pseudonym used in this example. He or she currently resides in Walla Walla, Washington.
<br />
<br />
<b>StoryMenu</b><br />
[[About the Author]]
</p>
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Take care with the length of your menu items. A link will be displayed on a single line,
even if it means that it will overlap your story's text.
</p>

<p class="caution">
It's important that these passages' names are spelled and capitalized properly.
