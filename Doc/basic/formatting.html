Sometimes you'd like to apply styles to your text &mdash; to italicize a book title, for example. You can do
this with simple formatting codes that are similar to the double brackets of a link. Here is what's available
to you:
</p>

<table>

<tr>
<th>Formatting</th>
<th>Source Code</th>
<th>Appears As</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Italics</td>
<td><code>//text//</code></td>
<td><i>text</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Boldface</td>
<td><code>''text''</code></td>
<td><b>text</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Underline</td>
<td><code>__text__</code></td>
<td><u>text</u></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Subscript</td>
<td><code>H~~2~~O</code></td>
<td>H<sub>2</sub>O</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Superscript</td>
<td><code>meters/second^^2^^</code></td>
<td>meters/second<sup>2</sup></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Monospace</td>
<td><code>{{{text}}}</code></td>
<td><code>text</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Bulleted list</td>
<td><code>* one<br />* two<br /></code></td>
<td><ul><li>one</li><li>two</li></ul></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Numbered list</td>
<td><code># one<br /># two</code></td>
<td><ol><li>one</li><li>two</li></ol></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Horizontal line</td>
<td><code>----</code></td>
<td><hr /></td>
</tr>

Lists in particular are useful for setting off choices at the end of a passage. Although it feels natural to
leave an empty line between a paragraph and a list, this creates extra whitespace that looks a little strange.
Here's what it should look like:
</p>

<blockquote><code>
It's a dark and stormy night aboard the Orient Express. You can't sleep; something about the motion of the train disturbed you subtly. So instead you have elected to spend the night in the dining car, sipping coffee and perusing [[the newspaper|The London Times]].<br />
<br />
You hear the door to the car open behind you.<br />
* [[Look up]]<br />
* [[Continue reading]]<br />
</code></blockquote>

If there's a particular kind of formatting that you'd like to use that isn't supported natively by Twee, you
can put HTML source code directly into your story's text by surrounding it with <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. This passage, for example, blinks:
</p>

<blockquote><code>
The bomb's timer now reads: &lt;html&gt;&lt;blink&gt;5:00&lt;/blink&gt;&lt;/html&gt;. You sure hope that's five hours, not five minutes.
