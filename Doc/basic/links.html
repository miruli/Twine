Links are the glue between passages. They are the equivalent of being told to turn to another page in
a nonlinear book; in gamebooks, for example, you do this to make decisions for the main
character. But this isn't the only possible kind of link. Deena Larsen describes a whole taxonomy of
links in <a href="http://www.deenalarsen.net/fundamentals/links.html">Fundamentals: A Rhetorical Devices
for Electronic Literature</a>.
</p>

<p>
Links are marked in the text of a passage by two square brackets, <code>[[like this]]</code>. For
simplicity's sake, the text between the brackets matches the title of the passage it links to &mdash;
remember that passage titles are case-sensitive.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to change what text is shown to the reader for a link, however. This can come in handy
if you need to put a capitalized passage title in the middle of a sentence, for example. The format
for this kind of link is slightly different: <code>[[displayed text|title of passage]]</code>. 
</p>

<p>
If a story has a broken link in it, it is displayed with a red background in your story, and clicking
it shows this message:
</p>

<p align="center">
<i>The passage 'The newspaper' doesn't exist.</i>
</p>

<p>
Finally, you may build links to external sites. These links look like this:
<code>[[Google|http://www.google.com/]]</code> You may link to any address that a reader's Web browser
will understand.
